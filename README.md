# Advanced Machine Learning Project - Domain-To-Text
 
## Dataset
The **PACS dataset** could be reached from the [Datasets](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pQlXKQSBjcBPqHQHxTl1bfgs9TRr2tk3?usp=sharing) google drive folder. It is saved in a ***.zip format*** and in the [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LyDXBj6gS-bt937Rzcgc6YWQ8zsviiTS#scrollTo=gi1t1dKcNeS2) there is no need to to save it on your google drive environment. In any case you can of course download it: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pQlXKQSBjcBPqHQHxTl1bfgs9TRr2tk3?usp=sharing

## Pretrained models

In order to reproduce the values reported in the table (see section 1 of the [project specifications](https://github.com/steo13/aml-domain2text-project/blob/main/project_specifications.pdf)), you have to use the **initial outputs** which could be reached from the [outputs](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mjMaP4loQtK5DB26tlv3uvn4rXmDbmk4?usp=sharing). They are saved in a ***.zip format*** and in the [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LyDXBj6gS-bt937Rzcgc6YWQ8zsviiTS#scrollTo=gi1t1dKcNeS2) there is no need to save them on your google drive environment. In any case you can of course donwload them: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mjMaP4loQtK5DB26tlv3uvn4rXmDbmk4?usp=sharing

## Environment

1) All the requirements for the project are listed under the file [requirements.txt](https://github.com/steo13/aml-domain2text-project/blob/main/requirements.txt)
2) In the folder [describing_textures](https://github.com/steo13/aml-domain2text-project/tree/main/describing_textures) there is the model used to get the new weights
3) The notebook associated to the project is: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LyDXBj6gS-bt937Rzcgc6YWQ8zsviiTS#scrollTo=gi1t1dKcNeS2
