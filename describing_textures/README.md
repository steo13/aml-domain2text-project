## Describing Textures using Natural Language section

This is the section for the ECCV 2020 paper "Describing Textures using Natural Language". More contents are shared on [the project webpage](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~chenyun/texture/). This section was an ***inspiration*** as well as the ***starting point*** for the development of the project

Our collected annotations are in `data_api/data/image_desciptions_d2t.json`. `data_api` includes all basic data handling code. 
PACS images should be put under `data_api/data/images`. They can be downloaded or used in connection with what is written in the [previous README.md](https://github.com/steo13/aml-domain2text-project#readme)

Code for training and evaluating the ***baseline triplet_match model*** is under `models/triplet_match`.
We also include additional application and visualization code.

More documentation will be added to this section. Feel free to contact `chenyun _AT_ cs.umass.edu` if you have any questions.
